TASM Encoder Validation - SIZE MISMATCH REPORT
================================================================================
Total Size Mismatches: 0

[OK] All size mismatches have been resolved with -O32 (force 32-bit).

This means all instructions that had size differences between TASM
(16-bit encoding) and the reference (32-bit encoding) were successfully
re-encoded using the -O32 flag and now match the reference opcodes.
